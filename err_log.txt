Be sure to have npm, NodeJS already installed in Linux.

The windows and Linux versions work the same, but have a few differences
  The Linux version works easily, following the exact same steps as provided in the documentation.
  Windows version has to be tweaked a little bit.

Running the windows version in linux gave an error regarding some "event.js".


LOG 1 complete.=================================================================


Not able to use the regex : -
commentMultiLine: $ => (/./|/\n/)*,
                                ^
SyntaxError: Unexpected token ,

----------------------------------

Not able to use the regex : -
commentMultiLine: $ => repeat(choice( /./, /\n/) ),

The rule `commentMultiLine` matches the empty string.
Tree-sitter does not support syntactic rules that match the empty string
unless they are used only as the grammar's start rule.

==================================
Instead used :-
commentMultiLine: $ => seq(repeat(choice(/./, /\n/)),'|#'),

                        AND

comments: $ => choice(
    seq(';', $.commentSingleLine),
    seq('#|', $.commentMultiLine)
),

BASICALLY, removed the multiline closing tag from $.comments and put it in $.commentMultiLine, therefore $.commentMultiLine is no longer an empty string even if we comment with => #||#, ie, nothing inside.
(
    SAME THING happened for commentSingleLine),
    for a case which might have => ;\n
)
